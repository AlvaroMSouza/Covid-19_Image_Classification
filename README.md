# Covid-19_Image_Classification
 The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images as COVID-19 positive or negative. The solution focuses on minimizing both false positives (to prevent unnecessary quarantines) and false negatives (to ensure timely intervention).
